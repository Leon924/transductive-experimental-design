# QPSolver

This code has been generated by the MatLab [code-generator](https://de.mathworks.com/help/coder/ref/codegen.html), which compiles MatLab code to C code.

Specifically, for the QPSolver I've used this code for qpsolver.m found [here](https://de.mathworks.com/help/optim/ug/code-generation-for-quadprog-example.html).
